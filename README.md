# PersonalDigitalDiary
University Project - Multimedia Trends (Group Name: FoulMouth)

The assignment we were given was to create a digital calendar/diary app for Android.
We decided to opt for an app that acts mostly as a to-do list for menial tasks since no phone in existince doesn't have a calendar app which people use, so copying an app like that would be fairly pointless.
The application would allow you to set reminders for tasks which it would then sort chronologically. It would also e-mail you the tasks that would need to be done for that day every day, the idea being that you can punch things into the app and pretty much forget about them, it would then remind you via e-mail instead of push notifications as we already get so many of those, being reminded of something mundane would just get ignored.
In essence we created digital writing stuff on your hand in sharpie.
